This pack contains 43 fully animated tropical trees and plants.
I suggest to get familiar with the demo scene first, but if you decide to use the models directly, use prefabs.
Open Prefabs folder and you will see 2 subfolders 'Animated' and 'Static'.
The 'Static' one contains all trees and plants in non animated version.
Open any folder. You will find 13 or 14 subfolders there (Depending on the chosen folder. The static one contains additional 'Dead Trees' subfolder 
that contains mainly fallen trees without animation) that represent species of trees and plants.

To see all trees and plants open SampleScene. You can click the buttons on the screen to switch between all trees and plants included in the pack.
